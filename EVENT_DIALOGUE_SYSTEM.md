## Overview

Psyokin uses a **CSV-driven event and dialogue system** to manage all narrative content, NPC interactions, and world state. This design enables:

- **Multi-language support** via separate dialogue CSV files per language
- **Data-driven content** that can be edited without code changes
- **Branching dialogue paths** based on player choices and game state
- **Dynamic NPC behavior** tied to calendar, morality, and story progression
- **Scalable event management** for monthly critical events and mission triggers
- **Flexible world tracking** for NPCs, items, and shops across the overworld

### Core Features

- **Event System**: Calendar-based and trigger-based events stored in CSV
- **Dialogue System**: Branching conversations with choice nodes and conditions
- **Emoji System**: Visual expressions displayed above character heads
- **NPC Tracking**: Calendar-aware location system (where NPCs are each day)
- **Mission System**: Quest definitions with objectives, rewards, and locations
- **Item Locations**: Overworld item placements defined in CSV
- **Shop System**: Dynamic shop inventories based on story progression
- **Morality Reactions**: NPC behavior changes based on player morality score
- **Monthly Events**: Critical story events each month with failure conditions

## Event System

### Event Types

| Type | Trigger | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Calendar Event** | Specific date/time | Events that occur on exact calendar days |
| **Trigger Event** | Location + Condition | Events triggered by player entering locations |
| **Critical Event** | Monthly deadline | Required story events (fail = game over) |
| **Mission Event** | Mission progress | Events triggered by mission completion/failure |
| **Morality Event** | Morality threshold | Events unlocked/changed by morality level |

### Event Flow

```
1. EVENT_CHECK
   ├── CalendarSystem emits day_advanced signal
   ├── EventManager checks calendar_events.csv for current date
   ├── Player enters location trigger
   └── EventManager checks trigger_events.csv for conditions

2. EVENT_TRIGGER
   ├── Load event definition from CSV
   ├── Check prerequisites (flags, morality, missions, etc.)
   ├── If conditions met → Queue event
   └── If conditions not met → Skip

3. EVENT_EXECUTION
   ├── Transition to event scene (if needed)
   ├── Play cutscene/animation (if defined)
   ├── Launch DialogueManager with dialogue_id
   ├── Process dialogue choices
   └── Apply event outcomes (flags, items, missions, etc.)

4. EVENT_COMPLETION
   ├── Mark event as completed (GameState.completed_events)
   ├── Update story flags
   ├── Emit event_completed signal
   └── Resume player control
```

### Event Priority System

Events are prioritized when multiple trigger simultaneously:

1. **Critical Events** (monthly deadlines) - highest priority
2. **Story Events** (main narrative progression)
3. **Mission Events** (active mission triggers)
4. **NPC Events** (dialogue interactions)
5. **Environmental Events** (location discoveries, item finds)

### Event Conditions

Events can be gated by multiple conditions:

- **Date/Time**: `month >= 5`, `day == 15`, `time_of_day == "evening"`
- **Story Flags**: `flag_met_npc_x == true`, `chapter >= 3`
- **Morality**: `morality >= 50`, `morality < -30`
- **Missions**: `mission_id_completed == "main_001"`, `active_mission == "side_05"`
- **Party**: `has_party_member("alice")`, `party_size >= 2`
- **Inventory**: `has_item("KeyCard_A")`, `item_count("Bind_Basic") >= 3`
- **Combat**: `battles_won >= 10`, `enemies_captured >= 5`

---

## Dialogue System

### Dialogue Architecture

The dialogue system uses a **node-based branching structure** with support for:
- Linear dialogue sequences
- Player choice branches (2-4 options)
- Conditional dialogue variants (based on flags, morality, etc.)
- Auto-branching (NPC reacts differently based on game state)
- Looping dialogue (repeatable conversations)

### Dialogue Node Types

| Node Type | CSV Flag | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Text** | `TEXT` | Standard dialogue line (speaker + text) |
| **Choice** | `CHOICE` | Player choice node (branches to different paths) |
| **Branch** | `BRANCH` | Auto-branch based on condition (no player input) |
| **Action** | `ACTION` | Trigger game action (give item, set flag, start battle, etc.) |
| **End** | `END` | Dialogue ends, return to gameplay |
| **Jump** | `JUMP` | Jump to different dialogue node/sequence |

### Dialogue Flow

```
1. DIALOGUE_START
   ├── DialogueManager.start_dialogue(dialogue_id, npc_id)
   ├── Load dialogue CSV from LocalizationManager (current language)
   ├── Parse dialogue tree starting at root node
   └── Emit dialogue_started signal

2. DIALOGUE_DISPLAY
   ├── DialogueUI shows character portrait
   ├── Display speaker name
   ├── Typewriter effect for text (configurable speed)
   ├── Wait for player input (A button to advance)
   └── If choices → Show choice buttons

3. DIALOGUE_CHOICE
   ├── Display 2-4 choice buttons
   ├── Player selects choice (A button)
   ├── Record choice in GameState.dialogue_choices
   ├── Branch to next node based on choice_id
   └── Some choices affect morality/flags

4. DIALOGUE_ACTION
   ├── Execute action node (give item, set flag, etc.)
   ├── Update GameState accordingly
   ├── Continue to next node
   └── Actions can trigger events/battles/scenes

5. DIALOGUE_END
   ├── Fade out dialogue box
   ├── Return control to player
   ├── Emit dialogue_ended signal
   └── Resume overworld gameplay
```

### Branching Logic

**Choice-Based Branching**:
```
Node 1: "Do you want to help me?"
  → Choice A: "Yes, I'll help." → Node 2A (accept quest)
  → Choice B: "No, sorry." → Node 2B (decline quest)
  → Choice C: "What's in it for me?" → Node 2C (negotiate)
```

**Conditional Branching**:
```
Node 1: Check player morality
  → If morality >= 30 → Node 2A (friendly greeting)
  → If morality <= -30 → Node 2B (hostile greeting)
  → Else → Node 2C (neutral greeting)
```

**Flag-Based Branching**:
```
Node 1: Check if player has met NPC before
  → If flag_met_alice == true → Node 2A ("Good to see you again!")
  → Else → Node 2B ("Hello, I'm Alice. Nice to meet you!")
```

### Dialogue Variables

Dialogue text supports variable substitution:

- `{player_name}` - Player character name
- `{morality}` - Current morality score
- `{date}` - Current in-game date
- `{item_name}` - Referenced item name
- `{npc_name}` - Current NPC speaker name
- `{choice_X}` - Previous choice made at node X

**Example**:
```
"Hello {player_name}, I heard you chose to {choice_5} yesterday. That takes courage."
```

### Repeatable Dialogue

NPCs can have multiple dialogue states:

- **First Meeting**: Plays once, sets flag `met_npc_X = true`
- **Repeatable Default**: Plays every time after first meeting
- **Event-Specific**: Plays during active events/missions
- **Post-Event**: Plays after event completion
- **Time-Specific**: Different dialogue based on time of day

## Emoji & Expression System

### Purpose

The Emoji System displays visual expressions above character heads in the overworld to convey emotions and reactions without dialogue.

### Emoji Types

| Emoji | Unicode | Meaning | Usage |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| 😊 | U+1F60A | Happy | NPC pleased with player, successful interaction |
| 😢 | U+1F622 | Sad | NPC disappointed, player made negative choice |
| 😡 | U+1F621 | Angry | NPC hostile, low morality reaction |
| ❤️ | U+2764 | Love | High affinity, romance option |
| ❓ | U+2753 | Confused | NPC doesn't understand, puzzle hint |
| ❗ | U+2757 | Surprised | Discovery, sudden realization |
| 💤 | U+1F4A4 | Sleeping | NPC unavailable (nighttime) |
| 💡 | U+1F4A1 | Idea | Mission available, hint |
| 💰 | U+1F4B0 | Money | Shop available, trade opportunity |
| ⚔️ | U+2694 | Combat | Battle encounter imminent |
| 🎁 | U+1F381 | Gift | Item available, reward ready |
| 🔒 | U+1F512 | Locked | Area/dialogue locked by conditions |
| ✅ | U+2705 | Complete | Mission complete, objective done |
| 🌟 | U+1F31F | Special | Rare event, critical NPC |

### Emoji Display Flow

```
1. EMOJI_TRIGGER
   ├── Event calls EmojiSystem.show_emoji(npc_id, emoji_type, duration)
   ├── Find NPC node in overworld scene
   ├── Create emoji sprite above NPC head
   └── Position emoji (NPC position + Vector2(0, -50))

2. EMOJI_ANIMATION
   ├── Fade in (0.2 seconds)
   ├── Bob animation (slight up/down movement)
   ├── Display duration (1.0-3.0 seconds)
   └── Fade out (0.2 seconds)

3. EMOJI_CLEANUP
   ├── Remove emoji sprite from scene
   └── Emit emoji_completed signal
```

### Emoji Integration

Emojis are triggered by:
- **Dialogue Actions**: `ACTION: show_emoji, npc_alice, happy, 2.0`
- **Proximity**: Player enters NPC interaction range
- **Events**: Automatic emoji on event trigger (e.g., `❗` when mission available)
- **Morality**: NPC shows `😡` or `😊` based on player morality
- **Time**: `💤` automatically shown for sleeping NPCs at night

---

## NPC Location Tracking

### System Purpose

NPCs move around the overworld based on **calendar day** and **time of day**, creating a living world with schedules.

### NPC Schedule Structure

Each NPC has a weekly schedule defining their location by:
- **Day of Week**: Monday-Sunday (or in-game equivalent)
- **Time of Day**: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night
- **Special Dates**: Override default schedule on specific calendar days

### Location Types

| Location Type | Description | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| **Overworld** | Specific position on map | `overworld_downtown, (150, 200)` |
| **Interior** | Inside building/scene | `scene_cafe_interior, npc_seat_1` |
| **Off-Map** | Not available | `null` (NPC not present today) |
| **Event** | Event-specific location | `event_school_assembly` |

### NPC Tracking Flow

   │   ├── Get location for current time slot
   │   ├── If location changed → Despawn from old location
   │   ├── Spawn at new location
   │   └── Update npc_current_locations dictionary

3. PLAYER_QUERY
   ├── Player enters location or interacts with NPC
   ├── NPCLocationSystem.get_npc_location(npc_id) → returns current position
   ├── NPCLocationSystem.get_npcs_at_location(location_id) → returns NPC list
   └── Used for dialogue triggers and mission objectives

4. SPECIAL_EVENTS
   ├── Event overrides NPC schedule
   ├── NPCLocationSystem.override_npc_location(npc_id, location, duration)
   ├── NPC moves to event location
   └── After event ends → Resume normal schedule
```

### Schedule Priority

When multiple schedules conflict:
1. **Event Override** (highest priority) - Active events override schedules
2. **Special Date** - Calendar-specific location (holidays, story dates)
3. **Weekly Schedule** - Default weekly pattern
4. **Fallback** - Default home location if no schedule defined

### NPC Availability

NPCs can be marked unavailable:
- **Story Gated**: NPC doesn't appear until story flag set
- **Mission Locked**: NPC busy during active mission
- **Time Locked**: NPC only appears during specific time ranges
- **Morality Locked**: NPC refuses to appear if morality too low/high

## Morality-Based NPC Reactions

### Morality Tiers

NPCs react differently based on player's morality score:

| Tier | Morality Range | Label | NPC Reaction |
|------|----------------|-------|--------------|
| **Saint** | 80-100 | Hero | Extremely friendly, discounts, special quests |
| **Good** | 40-79 | Upstanding | Friendly, normal interactions |
| **Neutral** | -39 to 39 | Citizen | Standard interactions |
| **Bad** | -79 to -40 | Troublemaker | Wary, higher prices, some NPCs refuse service |
| **Evil** | -100 to -80 | Villain | Hostile, shops refuse service, black market access |

### Reaction System

Each NPC can have up to 5 dialogue variants per interaction based on morality:

**Example**: NPC Shopkeeper greeting
- **Saint**: "Welcome back, hero! I saved my best items for you. 10% discount!"
- **Good**: "Hello! Thanks for shopping with us."
- **Neutral**: "What can I get you?"
- **Bad**: "I'm watching you. Don't cause trouble."
- **Evil**: "We don't serve your kind here. Get out."

### Morality Effects

| Effect | Saint | Good | Neutral | Bad | Evil |
|--------|-------|------|---------|-----|------|
| **Shop Prices** | -10% | 0% | 0% | +20% | Refused |
| **Mission Access** | All + Hero missions | All standard | Standard | Some locked | Villain missions only |
| **NPC Availability** | All available | Most available | Standard | Some refuse | Many refuse, black market opens |
| **Dialogue Tone** | Warm, grateful | Friendly | Professional | Cold, wary | Hostile, fearful |
| **Emoji Display** | ❤️😊 | 😊 | Neutral | 😡 | 😡🔒 |

### Reaction Triggers

Morality reactions update:
- **On Dialogue Start**: DialogueManager checks morality, loads appropriate variant
- **On Shop Enter**: ShopSystem applies price modifiers
- **On Mission Offer**: MissionSystem checks if NPC will offer mission
- **On Event Trigger**: EventManager selects morality-appropriate event path

### Dynamic Morality Events

Some events only trigger based on morality:
- **High Morality (≥50)**: "Heroic Request" events, NPCs ask for help
- **Low Morality (≤-50)**: "Villain Path" events, black market contacts player
- **Crossing Thresholds**: NPCs comment when player crosses from good→neutral→bad

## Monthly Critical Events

### System Purpose

Each in-game month requires the player to complete a **critical story event** or face **game over**. This creates urgency and narrative pacing.

### Critical Event Structure

Each month has:
- **Event ID**: Unique identifier
- **Event Name**: "Month 5 Crisis: Data Breach"
- **Unlock Date**: First day the event becomes available
- **Deadline Date**: Last day to complete event before game over
- **Prerequisites**: Story flags that must be set
- **Event Type**: Investigation, battle, choice sequence, etc.
- **Failure Consequence**: Game over message and bad ending flag

### Monthly Event Flow

```

### Critical Event Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Investigation** | Gather clues, talk to NPCs | "Solve the Data Breach mystery" |
| **Boss Battle** | Defeat critical enemy | "Stop the rogue AI" |
| **Choice Sequence** | Make critical story decision | "Choose alliance: Rebels or Corp" |
| **Rescue Mission** | Save NPC before time runs out | "Rescue kidnapped ally" |
| **Defense** | Protect location from attack | "Defend school from invasion" |
| **Infiltration** | Sneak into enemy base | "Infiltrate black market HQ" |

### Failure Consequences

When player fails critical event:
- **Game Over (Default)**: Load last save or start over
- **Bad Timeline (Optional)**: Continue with consequences
  - NPCs react negatively
  - Some content locked
  - Worse ending path
  - Harder difficulty

### Alternate Paths

Some critical events offer multiple solutions:
- **Heroic Path**: Complete event morally (high morality)
- **Neutral Path**: Complete event pragmatically
- **Villain Path**: Complete event ruthlessly (low morality)

All paths complete the event, but affect:
- Morality score
- NPC reactions
- Available missions
- Ending variations

## Localization & Multi-Language Support

### Supported Languages

Initial languages:
- **English (en)** - Default
- **Spanish (es)**
- **French (fr)**
- **Japanese (jp)**

Additional languages easily added by creating new CSV folders.

### Localization Architecture

All text content is stored in language-specific CSV files:

```
data/csv/dialogue/
├── en/
│   ├── main_story.csv
│   ├── npcs.csv
│   ├── side_quests.csv
│   ├── items.csv
│   ├── missions.csv
│   └── ui.csv
├── es/
│   └── [same structure]
├── fr/
│   └── [same structure]
└── jp/
    └── [same structure]
```

### LocalizationManager

**Responsibilities**:
1. Detect and load player's selected language
2. Load all CSV files for current language
3. Provide lookup functions for translated text
4. Handle missing translations (fallback to English)
5. Support dynamic language switching

**API**:
```gdscript
# Get translated text
LocalizationManager.get_text(key: String) → String

# Get dialogue line
LocalizationManager.get_dialogue(dialogue_id: String, node_id: String) → String

# Get item name/description
LocalizationManager.get_item_name(item_id: String) → String
LocalizationManager.get_item_desc(item_id: String) → String

# Get mission data
LocalizationManager.get_mission_name(mission_id: String) → String
LocalizationManager.get_mission_desc(mission_id: String) → String

# Get UI text
LocalizationManager.get_ui(ui_key: String) → String

# Change language at runtime
LocalizationManager.set_language(lang_code: String)
```

### Text Key Format

All text keys follow this format:

```
dialogue_<dialogue_id>_<node_id>
item_<item_id>_name
item_<item_id>_desc
mission_<mission_id>_name
mission_<mission_id>_desc
ui_<ui_element>
```

**Examples**:
- `dialogue_main_01_node_05` - Main story dialogue
- `item_Potion_name` - "Potion"
- `item_Potion_desc` - "Restores 50 HP"
- `mission_side_03_name` - "Lost Cat"
- `ui_start_game` - "Start Game"

### Variable Substitution

All languages support variable substitution:

**English**: `"Hello {player_name}, welcome to {location}!"`
**Spanish**: `"¡Hola {player_name}, bienvenido a {location}!"`
**French**: `"Bonjour {player_name}, bienvenue à {location} !"`
**Japanese**: `"こんにちは{player_name}さん、{location}へようこそ！"`

Variables are language-agnostic and replaced at runtime.

## Integration Points

### CalendarSystem Integration

All systems hook into CalendarSystem:

```gdscript
# Listen to calendar signals
CalendarSystem.day_advanced.connect(_on_day_advanced)
CalendarSystem.month_changed.connect(_on_month_changed)
CalendarSystem.time_changed.connect(_on_time_changed)

func _on_day_advanced(year: int, month: int, day: int):
    # EventManager: Check calendar events
    # NPCLocationSystem: Update NPC schedules
    # ItemLocationSystem: Respawn daily items
    # ShopSystem: Restock shops
    # MissionSystem: Check mission deadlines
```

### MoralitySystem Integration

Morality affects multiple systems:

```gdscript
# Get current morality
var morality = MoralitySystem.get_current_morality()

# DialogueManager: Select dialogue variant
var dialogue_variant = get_dialogue_for_morality(morality)

# ShopSystem: Apply price modifiers
var final_price = base_price * get_morality_price_modifier(morality)

# EventManager: Check morality-gated events
if morality >= event.min_morality and morality <= event.max_morality:
    trigger_event(event)

# NPCLocationSystem: Some NPCs refuse to appear
if morality < npc.min_morality_to_appear:
    return null # NPC not available
```

### GameState Integration

All systems save/load state through GameState:

```gdscript
# Save data
GameState.completed_events = EventManager.get_completed_events()
GameState.dialogue_choices = DialogueManager.get_choice_history()
GameState.collected_items = ItemLocationSystem.get_collected_items()
GameState.active_missions = MissionSystem.get_active_missions()
GameState.completed_missions = MissionSystem.get_completed_missions()
GameState.npc_flags = NPCLocationSystem.get_npc_flags()
GameState.shop_purchases = ShopSystem.get_purchase_history()

# Load data
EventManager.load_state(GameState.completed_events)
DialogueManager.load_state(GameState.dialogue_choices)
ItemLocationSystem.load_state(GameState.collected_items)
MissionSystem.load_state(GameState.active_missions, GameState.completed_missions)
```

### UI Integration

UI elements display data from all systems:

**Mission Tracker UI**:
- Pulls active missions from MissionSystem
- Displays objective progress
- Shows time remaining for time-limited missions

**Map UI**:
- Shows NPC locations from NPCLocationSystem
- Displays mission objective markers from MissionSystem
- Shows item collectible locations from ItemLocationSystem
- Highlights event locations from EventManager

**Dialogue Box UI**:
- Renders text from LocalizationManager
- Displays character portraits
- Shows choice buttons from DialogueManager
- Plays emojis from EmojiSystem

**Calendar UI**:
- Shows current date from CalendarSystem
- Highlights critical event deadlines from EventManager
- Shows NPC schedules from NPCLocationSystem

---
